<h3>Abstract:</h3>
<p>Nowadays, data analysis has been playing a major role in various fields and required in many domains. 

This work covers a detailed description of Formal Concept Analysis which covers how different processes in data analysis can be performed with the help of concepts. 

The work begins by finding the concepts from the context followed by performing tasks like association rule mining, stability and clustering. </p>
<b>Keywords : Data Analysis, Formal Concept Analysis, Association Rule Mining, Clustering, Stability, Concepts.</b>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Formal concept analysis is a method of data analysis which deals with object-attribute input data and aims at extracting from the data conceptual clusters also called formal concepts and data dependencies.

It acquires groupings, called formal concepts, from Boolean data named context, comprising of objects and attributes.

3.  Browse to your desired directory where you wish to clone the files and type:
    
     git clone [repository_URL] 

4. GitHub may ask for authorization, do the necessary and switch to the project directory you just cloned.

    cd project-you-just-cloned

5. Create a branch for better manageability and tracking of changes.

    git branch your-branch-name

6. Switch to your branch: git checkout your-branch-name

7. Start making changes and providing your vital contributions.

8. After you're done with the changes. Do:

    git status //to check your files which have been modified/added/deleted
   
    git add . //to add all the files to staging area, ready to be committed 

    git commit -m "Should be a one liner commit message, though  let your creativity spark here!"
    
9. Finally we're ready to push our work! 
   
     git push your-branch-name

10. After pushing your work, make sure to create a pull request on GitHub to make sure you and I are even on the master branch! 

Congratulations 🎊 , you just contributed to our project.
